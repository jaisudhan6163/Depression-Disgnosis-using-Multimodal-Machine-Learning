# Depression Diagnosis using Multimodal Machine Learning
This project focuses on a machine learning solution using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models to diagnose depression by analyzing textual, audio, and video data. The goal is to leverage advanced deep learning techniques to provide a comprehensive assessment of an individual's mental health status.

### Text Data Analysis
- **LSTM Models**: Used for analyzing textual data from interviews to extract features indicative of depressive symptoms.
- **Preprocessing**: Includes tokenization, word vectorization, and sequence padding to ensure uniform input lengths.
- **Word2Vec Embeddings**: Captures semantic relationships between words, enhancing the model's ability to understand contextual nuances.

### Audio Data Analysis
- **LSTM for Audio**: Analyzes audio features (pitch, tone, speech rate, etc.) to detect emotional states related to depression.
- **COVAREP**: Provides robust speech processing algorithms including pitch tracking and speech polarity detection.

### Video Data Analysis
- **LSTM for Video**: Processes sequential frames of video data to extract facial expressions, gestures, and speech patterns indicative of depressive symptoms.
- **CLNF**: Constrained Local Neural Fields toolkit for facial landmark detection, enhancing facial feature recognition in varying conditions.

### LSTM Overview
- **Architecture**: Effective in capturing long-term dependencies and patterns in sequential data.
- **Applications**: Widely used in NLP, speech recognition, time series prediction, and gesture recognition.

### Fusion Model
- **Integration**: Combines outputs from text, audio, and video analyses using a weighted approach to enhance diagnostic accuracy.
- **Comprehensive Assessment**: Provides a nuanced evaluation of an individual's mental health, leveraging multiple modalities.

### Conclusion
This project aims to advance depression diagnosis through state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, offering mental health professionals a powerful tool for informed decision-making and personalized patient care.
